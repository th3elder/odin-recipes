    <p><strong>Summertime is the perfect time to enjoy smoothies for breakfast, and this Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie has been on repeat!</p> 
    <p>It’s a healthy smoothie recipe that’s ultra thick, easy to make, and tastes amazing. What more could you want?!</p>
    <p>Whip this up in minutes, with just 5 ingredients (bananas, milk, peanut butter, honey, and oats). Great for hectic mornings when you are running out the door or for a quick snack!</strong></p>

    <ul><h3><u>List of ingredients:</u></h3></ul>
        <li><strong>Bananas:</strong> For best results, use frozen ripe bananas to ensure the smoothie is cold, thick, and has a natural sweetness.</li>
        <li> <strong>Milk:</strong> We usually use unsweetened vanilla almond milk, but feel free to use any milk that you like.</li>
        <li><strong>Peanut butter:</strong> Creamy peanut butter adds tons of delicious flavor. To keep this recipe clean, use natural peanut butter. Alternatively, almond butter or another nut (or seed) butter may be substituted.</li>
        <li><strong> Sweetener:</strong>You can make this smoothie sweeter by adding honey or agave.</li>
        <li><strong>Oats:</strong>This will bulk up the smoothie and make it super thick.</li>
